# Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I recently purchased an *idevice*. "Fantastic", I hear you say, but what's that
got to do with 1password? 

For years I've been an ardent keepassxc user, syncing database files between devices
using syncthing or similar self hosted tools and annoying everyone with the warm glow
of smug self reliance.
Sadly, Idevices don't like that kind of thing. It's iCloud or the highway for syncing files.
Not wanting to iCloud all the things I decided to check out the big bad world of
cloud hosted secrets management.

> Spoiler, I fell in love

While searching online it quickly became obvious that there are two big players, 1password
and bitwarden. Bitwarden has options for self hosting, but 1password came with a glowing
review from my mate.

I decided to give 1password some money based on the following features:

* Everything their side is encrypted, with keys supplied by the client
* Great reputation across the industry
* CLI tools for accessing secrets
* RBAC and granular sharing capabilities
* Applications for every operating system I use
* Browser extensions for firefox and chrome

I started testing the water, moving a few things from keepassxc into 1password.
A few days later I threw down a 1password subscription for a year. Here's why:

## SSH Key Management

## Secrets Automation

## Fastmail Integration

## CLI Config File Rendering

## Item Templates
