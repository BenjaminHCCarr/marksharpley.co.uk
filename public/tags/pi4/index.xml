      <description>Introduction Before we dive into the technical aspect of this blog post there should probably be some explanation for how we got here.
Like many of us, I&amp;rsquo;ve at times struggled with the balance of remote work, lockdown and my personal life. I&amp;rsquo;ve done all the usual stuff - bread baking, home IOT setup, and a lot of cycling but there was another itch which required scratching.

      <title>k3s, Ubuntu 19.10 and a Pi4</title>

      <description>On the matter of Operating Systems Raspian is perfectly good, but there are a few niggles. It isn&amp;rsquo;t 64 bit, so running things like mongodb is a problem. Also, it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to use cloud-init to preconfigure some stuff, such as SSH keys. If you want to try a 64 bit OS for your Pi4, Ubuntu is a solid option.
cgroup_memory = 0 cgroup_memory is disabled by default on raspbian and is required for k8s.</description>

      <title>OpenFAAS via Containerd on a Raspberry PI 4</title>

      <description>Intro OpenFAAS is a serverless tool. One of the things I like most about it - it&amp;rsquo;s pretty agnostic. You can bring your own infra or orchestrator and roll with Dockerfiles. No vendor lock in!
Their tagline: OpenFaaSÂ® makes it simple to deploy both functions and existing code to Kubernetes
While it is mainly used with k8s, there are also providers for other orchestrators, such as Hashicorp&amp;rsquo;s Nomad. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll be trying out a new provider for Containerd on my Raspberry Pi 4b.</description>
