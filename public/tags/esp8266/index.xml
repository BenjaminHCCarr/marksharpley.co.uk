      <description>Intro Around five years ago I purchased some smart light bulbs. They are designed to be used with a smart hub, on of these. Turns out that the company behind this has made a new version of the hub, the miboxer, which is not backwards compatible with the older bulbs. It also requires an android account with rather dubious permission requirements to use.
I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of this kind of behaviour from companies and would rather reuse things where possible.</description>
